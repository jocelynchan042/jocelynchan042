## Hi, I'm Jocelyn!ðŸ‘‹
I'm a Computer Science and Data Science student at Boston University with a passion for AI, software engineering, and game development. I enjoy solving real-world problems through data-driven tools and thoughtful design. I'm currently exploring AI models and how to utilize generative AI to streamline workplace processes. I'm always looking to learn, build, and collaborate on impactful projects!

## ðŸŽ¯ Featured Project: World Happiness Levels AI Model
This project explores the use of machine learning models to classify countries into Low, Medium, or High happiness categories based on socio-economic, health, and governance indicators. Using the World Happiness Report dataset, I build and compare Logistic Regression and Random Forest models to evaluate their performance in predicting a countryâ€™s happiness class.
